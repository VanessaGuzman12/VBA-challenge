# VBA-challenge

I created a 3 scripts:

-Ticker script does a loop that output the following information:
The ticker symbol 
Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock.
and also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

-Challenge script is  able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

-Loop_sheets script run both scripts mentioned above through all the sheets.

Also I add the sreen shot for the results in each year in the Multi Year Stock Data workbook.
